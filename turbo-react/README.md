Todo Application built using

- ReactJS + Vite
- TailwindCSS

I had to implement some of the new things I've been learning so far on react. I used react libraries such as:

- React.useState()
- React.useEffect()

I also used a random id generator I first discovered on the react tutorial video provided by freecodecamp on youtube which is ~12hrs long

```js
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';

const newTodo = {
  id: nanoid(),
  ...formData,
};
```
